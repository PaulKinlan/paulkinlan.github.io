I just realised that I never followed my own advice to watch the videos on MSDN.  I just watched
<br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/programming/classlibraries/membertypes/">Designing .NET Class Libraries: Member Types</a> and I have to admit, this guy talks sense :)  
<p />
Even though I have done a lot of c#, it is very interesting what "the" people talk about and their basic standards. I liked his arguments for cohesion of overloaded methods.  I think I will try and follow that advice.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-111375862679081661?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
