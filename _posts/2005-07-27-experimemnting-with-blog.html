I am trying to get the readership of this blog up.  Currently it is about 1 :).  Anyway, I thought that it might be wort including some more links in each of my blog posts.<p />At the end of every article I am going to put a link to a Technorati Tag RSS feed relating to the post.  Hopefully you will be able to see in a feed browser other people who are interested in the same things I am talking about.<p /><a href="http://feeds.technorati.com/feed/posts/tag/Blog">[[posterous-content:IzaovAlwxvhGDirAakdz]] Other Related Articles</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-112249198627912469?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
