I have been looking for a way to update my Blogs image. I like what I have, but it is quite generic.<p />I was looking at this site <a href="http://penandthink.com/niggle/">http://penandthink.com/niggle/</a> and I really like the way it shows the Blog post.<p />I am not too sure if I can really use this as a basis for my site, because I have been posting a lot recently, so it won't stay too static...... Saying that, it might work.<p /><strong>A quick question for anyone out there:</strong>  If you went to a Blog, do you prefer one item that is shown, or a full list?<p />Currently my page I show the last 30 posts.  So that you can browse them if you like.  Would you prefer the current entry at the top, and then a summary of entries beneath?<p />All emails would be greatly appreciated:  <a href="mailto:paul.kinlan@gmail.com">paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
