title: Another Thing I just noticed
published: true
---
After months and months at being at the bottom of Technorati Rankings (because I had no one linking to me), I just noticed [besides other problems that I have had with Technorati] that someone had linked to me.  It was someone whose article I read after they left a comment in my blog.  When I read his blog, I didn't realise he linked to me.<p />But yay, I have an inward link :)<p />Thanks Zoli ;)<p />You know, I criticize a service, it gets fixed and works for me, and I feel bad for criticizing :)<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
