title: "The Failures of my First AJAX application: Part 7"
published: true
---
This is the 7th instalment of the failures of my first AJAX application and more commonly know was "It generated no feedback from anyone at all!"<p />As in my previous post, when I was creating the application I had grand ideas about the people who might use this application. I had visions of thousands and thousands of people using it and having to ring up Yahoo to ask to have my 5000 daily query limit increased.<p />In actual fact, I was really the only person who used the application. Even though I was posting about it in my journal I didnâ€™t receive any feedback at all from the public.<p />This got me thinking. Even though the application is primarily for my benefit I would dearly love other people to use it. I would also need to get people talking about it. I would also need all the information to be available in one place (regarding the AJAXTagger).<p />My first step to more exposure is this Blog. All my content will still be aggregated on <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk">http://www.kinlan.co.uk</a>, but this blog is designed to deliver all the information about the development and use of the application in one simple place.<p />My next step after this will be to promote it. I need people to start talking about it; I need people to investigate the functionality it offers; I need you to use it, break it and criticise it!<p />Do you have any ideas how I might do this? Email me or leave a comment. I need the feedback to make this application better for me and for you. Every comment and suggestion will be taken on board.<p /><a href="mailto:Paul.kinlan@gmail.com">Paul.kinlan@gmail.com</a><p /><br /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
