I just noticed that when I went to any of the pages on my site that have been linked from my main blog, then the title wasn't appearing at the top of the page, only the page URL.<p />Thanks to my <a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/AjaxExperiments/AjaxTag">AJAX Tagger </a>for pointing this out :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-112643242071162937?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
