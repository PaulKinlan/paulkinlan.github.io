We had a little baby boy on 11th October 2005 at 9:33am.<br /><strong>Jack Paul Francis Kinlan</strong>. 8lb 11<sup>1/2</sup>oz.<p />Mother and Baby are doing very very very very well! And are very very cute!!!<p />I didn't know whether to post about it not, so I have made up my mind.  We thought we would give him a quiet first week.<p /><table class="TechnoratiHead TagHeader">
