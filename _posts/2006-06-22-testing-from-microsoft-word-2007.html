title: Testing From Microsoft Word 2007
published: true
---
<span><p>I am just testing the Blog feature from Word 2007.  If this works it is pretty cool.<br /></p>
<p>I really love the interfaces to Excel, Word and PowerPoint.  The ribbon is sooo sweet. I am slightly disappointed so far with Visio.  Visio seems to be a simple rehash of earlier versions.<br /></p>
<p>Smart Art is pretty cool, it is appears to be CSS to the max!<br /></p>
<p>I may end up using Word 2007 permanently! </p></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-115096938897107372?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
