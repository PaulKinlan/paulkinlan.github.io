<p>With Reference to my previous post "<a href="http://www.kinlan.co.uk/2006/08/call-me-stupid.html">Call Me Stupid</a>" I have now got a plugin working.</p> <p>The only thing that I can say that I did was to start from the beging again.</p> <p>Over the next couple of days when I get chance, I am going to convert my Ajax Tagger to the Windows Live Writer Framework.Â  It should be a good experiment of create a Mashup of Web 2.0 API's into the Windows Live Writer Application.</p> <p>Keep following me for updates.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8109338-115599601919328138?l=www.kinlan.co.uk%2Findex.html" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
