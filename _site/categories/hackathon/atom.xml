    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oddly I rarely talk about Developer Relations, but I feel like changing that today.</p>

<p>I feel really uncomfortable when I hear people suggest Hackathons are a part of building a sustainable, scalable developer ecosystem.  </p>

<p><strong>They are not.</strong></p>

<p>I have run hackathons.  Some better than others.  I have learnt a lot about them.</p>

<p>Businesses and Platform creators:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are thinking of running a hackathon to win potential new customers <strong>you are doing it wrong</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you are wanting someone to start a business by using your platform at your hackathon <strong>you are doing it wrong</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you are running hackathons to raise brand awareness <strong>you are doing it wrong</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you are offering winners $SOMERANDOMLARGENUMBER <strong>you are doing it wrong</strong>.</li>
  <li>If your product team (PMs through to Eng) are not at the hackathon <strong>you are doing it wrong</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hackathons can be a thing of beauty, they can produce completely unexpected demos, but that is not your goal. You should be using it as a learning exercise for <strong>you</strong>, <strong>your team</strong> and <strong>fixing your product</strong>.  It is the developer version of a beta test, not a marketing tool.</p>

<p>Learn from the developers using your platform.  Ask yourselves the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do your demos work? are developers using the demos to build on top of them?</li>
  <li>Does your documentation work? can developers start by diving into the docs and following the guides step by step?</li>
  <li>Does your platform work?  Is your API intuitive?  Are developers getting stuck on certain parts?</li>
  <li>Is there value to your platform?  Is it possible for people to build sustainable integrations on your platform?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can answer all these questions at a Hackathon.  That is what you should be concentrating on.</p>

<p>One little point, rather than just rewarding teams who produce a lot, reward filing bugs and issues on all parts of your product, the apis, the documentation, the demos and the value as well.</p>
