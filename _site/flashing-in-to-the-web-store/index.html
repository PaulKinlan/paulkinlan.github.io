<div class="entry-content"><p>I have seen a lot of the talk in the media that the <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web
Store</a> is been about pushing the web
forwards with <em>just </em>HTML5 and Javascript.</p>

<p>For example, there are some awesome HTML based games in the store, such as
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poknhlcknimnnbfcombaooklofipaibk">Canvas Rider</a>,
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aelpbbhpcpelmnfablcbcianelefnnbg">Shredder Chess</a>
and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omlmnomieeknagejjojcpdomnbnbchdl">Sinous</a>
all accessible in any modern web browser written using HTML.</p>

<p>It seems to me at least that Flash has been missed by the media elements
reporting on the Web store.  Flash is an unbelievably important part of the
Web Eco-system and because of this is fully accessible though the Chrome
Webstore.</p>

<p>In my eyes, an excellent example is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ogcldakngnllchlnncngiailfhidjjdp?hl=en-US">Vyew</a>
or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oainjhllibnjfalecnohojnocpcobgpn">Paltalk</a>
which have a heavy emphasis on Flash and are amazing applications that do a
lot of things we can&rsquo;t do just yet in HTML (web cam access for instance).</p>

<p>If you have a Flash app or game it is really simple to get in the store, and
you have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li> You can use <a href="http://appmator.appspot.com">Appmator</a> to take your site
and create the package you need to get into the store, it literally takes
about two minutes and your app is still hosted on the web and under your
domain.</li>
<li> The second option, and a really powerful option is to package your SWF
into the zip file that you upload to the store.  Once it is in the store, we
distribute it for you, bandwidth and all.</li>
</ul>


<p>Think about it for a minute, if you package your game and upload it to the
store, <em>we</em> distribute that for you! And we also make sure that if you do an
update it is delivered to all users of your app.  If you had an amazingly
popular app like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jkempgfofnfmanpnnhiojeadfhhleicd">Canabalt</a> and
that was hosted entirely in the store, you would have no bandwidth costs.</p>

<p>I must strongly note, that the Web store is a platform for <em>users </em>to
discover great applications.  Users are in control here, if they like your
app it will be rated highly, if not then it won&rsquo;t be.  It is important that
you create high-quality apps and games for the store.</p>

<p>Here are my tips&hellip;.. actually it is a single tip for creating awesome Flash
games for the store, heck it is not even just Flash, all apps and Games
regardless of tech.</p>

<p><em>Make it as immersive as possible</em>.  I test a lot of apps and games, and
when I see them in a little box it makes me weep a little.  You have an
entire screen to work with &ndash; use it.  When I see a menu bar and site
navigation, I cringe a little.</p>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jkempgfofnfmanpnnhiojeadfhhleicd">Canabalt</a>
is a great example of this &ndash; it is all game.</p>

<p>If you have a Flash game or app, let me know and I can help you get it into
the store.</p>
